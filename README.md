# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction
This study utilizes the Hotel Booking Demand dataset from Kaggle, originally published by 
Antonio et al. (2018), to predict booking cancellations based on key attributes. A complete 
machine learning pipeline was developed, encompassing data collection, exploration, 
preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and 
interpretation. 
Class imbalance was addressed using SMOTE. Feature selection technique, Mutual 
Information were applied to identify the most influential predictors. The dataset was then used 
to train five machine learning models: Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost, AdaBoost 
Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier. Hyperparameter tuning 
was performed to optimize model performance, and evaluation metrics were analyzed to 
compare models. 
The study provides insights into the factors influencing cancellations and demonstrates the 
effectiveness of ensemble-based models in predictive analysis. Results indicate that Random 
Forest outperform other models in handling complex relationships within the dataset. This 
research contributes to improving predictive modelling for hotel booking cancellations.
